# PDFChatBot
This PDF Chatbot is a tool that lets you ask questions about your PDF documents. It uses AI to understand your questions and find the answers in the PDF. It's like having a smart assistant for your documents!

The main way the code is set up comes from Krishnaik06's work in his repository. You can find his original code here: https://github.com/krishnaik06/Complete-Langchain-Tutorials/tree/b9a6d67a93540cbf0cc28799c2963703811bfba9/chatmultipledocuments. I've made some changes to make it work better, like improving how it handles errors and making it faster. I also used some Chatgpt and some Gemini to refine the code and also I added explanation on what each function does. It's a great starter project for anyone that want to get into AI.

My Experience while making this bot:

Building this bot was a real learning experience! I had to brush up on my Python skills and get a better handle on programming basics.  What inspired me was seeing how AI is changing the world â€“ it made me want to dive in and start creating things myself.  I used to think programming wasn't for me, but now I'm excited to learn more and build AI-powered apps. This is my first project, and I learned a lot by watching videos and using tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Stack Overflow to understand the code and how everything fits together. It was a lot of fun (and a lot of debugging!), and I'm looking forward to building more projects to learn about LLMs and improve my Python with Langchain ðŸ˜„.
