# PDFChatBot
This PDF Chatbot is a tool that lets you ask questions about your PDF documents. It uses AI to understand your questions and find the answers in the PDF. It's like having a smart assistant for your documents!

Building this bot was a real learning experience! I had to brush up on my Python skills and get a better handle on programming basics.  What inspired me was seeing how AI is changing the world â€“ it made me want to dive in and start creating things myself.  I used to think programming wasn't for me, but now I'm excited to learn more and build AI-powered apps. This is my first project, and I learned a lot by watching videos and using tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Stack Overflow to understand the code and how everything fits together. It was a lot of fun (and a lot of debugging!), and I'm looking forward to building more projects to learn about LLMs and improve my Python with Langchain ðŸ˜„.
